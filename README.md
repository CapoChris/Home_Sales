# Home_Sales

-- Summary:

This project leverages PySpark to process a large-scale home sales dataset. Using SparkSQL, I analyzed average home sale prices based on variables such as bedroom count, number of floors, and square footage. Temporary views were created to perform SQL queries, and I evaluated performance differences between cached and uncached data to better understand Spark's in-memory processing capabilities.
